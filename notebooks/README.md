Here, we provide a couple tutorials that we hope will help the interested 
reader and hacker understand the core topics in this thesis. If you are not opting
to download this repository, we recommend viewing the notebooks with 
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), as equations will be better rendered than on GitHub!

Below is an overview of the notebooks and the corresponding nbviewer link.
