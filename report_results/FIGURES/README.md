All the figures in the report can be created by running:

```
python generate_figures.py
```

The PDF (and some PNG) files will be written to this directory.

For a particular figure, e.g. 'Figure 1.6', the image can be generated
(and with modified parameters) by running the corresponding script 
`'report_results/figXpX*.py'`, e.g. `'report_results/fig1p6_pulse_shape.py''`.

_Note: this is only true for those figures that were generated with Python, e.g.
simulations._
