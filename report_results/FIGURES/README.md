All the figures in the report can be created by running:

```
python generate_figures.py
```

The PDF (and some PNG) files will be written to this directory.

For a particular figure, the image can be generated (and with modified
parameters) by running the corresponding script 
`'report_results/figXpX*.py'`, e.g. 
`'report_results/fig1p6_pulse_shape.py'` for Figure 1.6 in the report.

_Note: this is only true for those figures that were generated with Python, e.g.
simulations._
